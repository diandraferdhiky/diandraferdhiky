## Hi there 👋

A person who loves and is enthusiastic about cognitive science and human behavior. His approach tends towards hard-line empiricism, especially in the end-to-end process of understanding human cognitive pathways. He is also interested in how psychological scales and body imaging tools with physiological scanning capabilities (PET, MRI, EEG, Eye Tracker) can be used to identify specific traits. Furthermore, his curiosity never stops exploring specific genetic traits that may be related to human cognitive traits and mental disabilities. His work focuses on adaptive assistive technology or simply spending time for fun.
