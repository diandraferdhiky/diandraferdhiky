## Hi there, welcome to my humble profile 👋

A dedicated explorer of cognitive science and human behavior with a strong interest in hard-line empiricism. Currently delving into the end-to-end process of cognitive pathways, I am particularly fascinated by the integration of psychological scales and neuroimaging tools—such as PET, MRI, and EEG—to identify human traits. My curiosity also extends to the intersection of genetics and mental health. I am driven to apply these insights toward the development of adaptive assistive technologies and evidence-based innovations.
